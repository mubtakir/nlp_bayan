## 💭 رسالة من المطور

لغة البيان هي حلم تحقق - لغة برمجة عربية حقيقية تجمع بين ثلاثة أنماط برمجية في لغة واحدة. 

هدفي هو تمكين المبرمجين العرب من البرمجة بلغتهم الأم، وفي نفس الوقت توفير أداة قوية ومرنة لجميع المبرمجين حول العالم.

البيان ليست مجرد لغة برمجة - إنها جسر بين الثقافات، وبين الأنماط البرمجية، وبين الماضي والمستقبل.

أتمنى أن تستمتعوا باستخدام البيان بقدر ما استمتعت بتطويرها!

**باسل يحيى عبدالله**
